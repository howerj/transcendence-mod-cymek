Soggy Doggy's 	One Piece Armor mod - - - The Needed Code:

In this zip is simply the, 1 graphic you'll need to create a ship
with one simgle piece of armor. But the following code you'll need 
for the XML code of the ship.


The following are a couple of examples using the new images:

RESOURCE:
<Image UNID="&nwg"ShipName"Armour;" bitmap="OneArmourHUD.bmp" backColor="0x00000000"/>

This is for the image reasource, the graphic name can be changed only if you change the
"OneArmourHUD" bit.

1 Segment Display:
			
	<ArmorDisplay>
		<ArmorSection name="forward"
				imageID="&nwg"ShipName"Armor;" 
				imageX="0" imageY="0" imageWidth="110" imageHeight="110"
				destX="13" destY="13" hpX="55" hpY="14"
				nameY="8" nameBreakWidth="200" nameDestX="0" nameDestY="10" />

	</ArmorDisplay>

This goes in the "Player settings" section, this shows, which entity it uses, the verious
settings needed to see the graphic and where the name of the armor and its hp goes.


Finally,

<Armor>
	<ArmorSection start="0" span="360" armorID="&itDesiredArmorPiece;" areaSet="0,2" />
</Armor>

This just states the In Game coverage of the armor piece, just add in whatever armor piece
you want and you're good! (No one seems to know what the area set is, so just leave it be).



NOTE:
for all the pro modders out there, sorry for the noob talk, just trying to be unnversaly 
understood.			<!-- SOGGY DOGGY HAS SPOKEN -->
