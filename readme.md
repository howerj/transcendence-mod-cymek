A game mod for Transcendence, it introduces a few unique new items as well as a
modded Hornet Battle Pod. The main items include:

* A nano-factory that can create many unique items from raw materials. It is
  available towards the end of the game, but produces items more useful to the
  beginning of the game.
* A CDM shard that acts like a more limited version of the one you obtain at
  the beginning of Eternity Port.
* A deployable container habitat that the player can name and use for item
  storage.
* A unique launcher that uses manufactured ammunition only, and is useless
  without the nano-factory or a stockpile of previously manufactured munitions.
* Many specialist items (for example a slotless micro-deflector only useful at
  low levels, or drones with no device slots).

You may find things need rebalancing, but there should not be anything that
really breaks the game, especially for players with lots of experience.

A list of TODO items is in `cymek.xml`.

# Licenses

The single armor image `OneArmorHUD.bmp` in the resources folder comes from the
mod <http://xelerus.de/index.php?s=mod&id=358>, which is not explicitly
released under a license but contains text that allows for its use in other
mods.

The mod <http://xelerus.de/index.php?s=mod&id=244> is also used for part of the
deployable barrel bombs, which is released under similar language, but again no
explicit license.

If there are problems, please contact me.
